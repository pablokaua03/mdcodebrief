## What is it?

`mdcodebrief` is a lightweight desktop tool that recursively scans a project folder and produces a single, well-structured Markdown file containing:

- A **visual directory tree** of the entire project
- Every **source file** with syntax-highlighted code blocks
- Relative paths, file sizes, and automatic truncation for large files

The output is designed to be **pasted directly into AI chat interfaces** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) so the model has complete, unambiguous context about your project — no copy-pasting individual files.

---

## When to use it

| Situation | How |
|---|---|
| **Ask an AI to review your code** | Run on the full project, paste the `.md` |
| **Code review / PR analysis** | Use `--diff` to export only changed files |
| **Onboarding a new dev** | Generate a full snapshot of the codebase |
| **Debug with AI help** | Add `-p "Find the bug in the auth flow"` |
| **Refactor with AI** | Add `-p "Refactor this to TypeScript"` |

> **When NOT to use:** projects with thousands of files or large generated assets — use `--diff` mode or point to a specific subfolder instead.

---

## Features

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| 🖥️ **Visual GUI** | Clean interface with dark/light theme toggle |
| ⌨️ **CLI mode** | Run headless for scripting or CI pipelines |
| 🌳 **Directory tree** | ASCII tree view at the top of every output file |
| 🎨 **Syntax highlighting** | 50+ extensions mapped to correct Markdown fences |
| 🔒 **Smart filtering** | Skips `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.git`, build dirs, lock files, binaries |
| 📋 **Native `.gitignore` support** | Reads and respects the project's `.gitignore` automatically |
| 📋 **Copy to clipboard** | One click (GUI) or `--copy` flag (CLI) |
| 🧮 **Token estimation** | Shows `~Xk tokens` with model recommendations |
| 🔀 **Git diff mode** | `--diff` — only scan files changed since last commit |
| 🤖 **AI instruction injection** | Prepend a custom prompt to the output |
| 🌗 **Dark / Light theme** | Toggle in the header — instant switch |
| 🧪 **Automated tests** | 36 unit tests covering scanner, renderer, gitignore parsing, token estimation, and diff safety |
| 📏 **Safety limits** | Files truncated at 1 000 lines; scan stops at 2 000 files |
| 🌍 **Cross-platform** | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| 📦 **Zero runtime dependencies** | Only the Python standard library is required to run from source |

## Quickstart

### Option A — Download the executable (no Python needed)

1. Download `mdcodebrief.exe` from the button above
2. Double-click to run

> ⚠️ **Windows SmartScreen warning:** Click **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"**. This is normal for open-source tools without a paid code signing certificate. You can also run directly from source with `python mdcodebrief.py`.

### Option B — Run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pablokaua03/mdcodebrief.git
cd mdcodebrief
python mdcodebrief.py
```

`mdcodebrief` itself uses only the Python standard library. On some Linux distributions, `tkinter` is provided as a separate system package such as `python3-tk`.

### CLI mode

```bash
python mdcodebrief.py /path/to/project
python mdcodebrief.py /path/to/project -p "Find the memory leak"
python mdcodebrief.py /path/to/project --diff --copy
python mdcodebrief.py /path/to/project --diff --copy -p "Review this PR"
```

---

## CLI options

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--hidden` | Include hidden folders/files |
| `--unknown` | Include files with unrecognised extensions |
| `--diff` | Git diff mode — changed files only |
| `--staged` | Staged files only (`git diff --cached`) |
| `-p / --prompt` | Inject an AI instruction at the top |
| `-c / --copy` | Copy output to clipboard |
| `-o / --output` | Custom output path |
| `--version` | Print version |

---

## Token estimation guide

| Tokens | Recommended models |
|---|---|
| < 8k | Most models |
| 8k – 32k | GPT-4o · Claude Sonnet · Gemini Flash |
| 32k – 128k | Claude 200k · Gemini 1.5 Pro |
| > 128k | Gemini 1.5 Pro 1M |

---

## Build from source

```bash
# Windows
.\build.bat

# Linux / macOS
chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
```

Building the standalone executable uses **PyInstaller** as an optional packaging dependency. It is not required to run `mdcodebrief` from source.

---

## Run tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/
```

---

## Security

- **Read-only** — never modifies your project files
- No network access, no telemetry, and no external runtime dependencies
- Hard limits prevent runaway scans
