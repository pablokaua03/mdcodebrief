# Contexta

**Curated context packs for debugging, onboarding, reviews, refactors, and AI handoffs. Contexta analyzes the project first, then exports the most useful context for the job.**

## What Contexta exports

Contexta builds a context pack instead of dumping files blindly. Depending on pack, mode, and task, the output can include:

- A project summary with detected technologies, entry points, likely purpose, and central modules
- A read-this-first path through the repository
- A main execution flow narrative for the most relevant runtime path
- Core files, supporting files, related tests, and changed-file context
- Relationship maps and hotspot/risk notes
- A curated Markdown payload ready to paste into ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, or another coding assistant

Full mode still preserves raw code payloads. The intelligence is added around the payload, not instead of it.

---

## Why it is useful

Contexta is designed for the annoying part of AI-assisted coding: deciding what the model actually needs to see.

Use it when you want to:

- explain a project quickly to another developer or model
- review a change set with nearby context
- debug with changed files and likely hotspots already grouped
- onboard into an unfamiliar codebase
- hand off work between AI tools without rebuilding context from scratch

---

## Main features

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| GUI + CLI | Desktop workflow for everyday use, plus command-line usage for scripting |
| Context packs | `custom`, `chatgpt`, `onboarding`, `pr_review`, `risk_review`, `debug`, `backend`, `frontend`, `changes_related` |
| Context modes | `full`, `debug`, `feature`, `diff`, `onboarding`, `refactor` |
| Compression modes | `full`, `balanced`, `focused`, `signatures` |
| Task-aware output | Shapes the export for explanation, bug reports, code review, risk analysis, refactors, tests, dead-code hunting, or AI handoff |
| Project fingerprinting | Detects stack, frameworks, and project type before selecting files |
| Relationship map | Highlights local dependencies and likely related tests |
| Changed Files + Context | Pulls changed files up and expands into nearby relevant code |
| Selection reasons | Explains why each file was included in the payload |
| Read This First + Main Flow | Makes the pack easier for humans and models to navigate |
| Token guidance | Uses `tiktoken`-backed estimates for tighter compression and safer pack sizing |
| Syntax-aware analysis | Uses tree-sitter plus heuristic fallback to extract symbols across multiple languages |
| Build pipeline | Uses Nuitka for Windows and PyInstaller plus a Linux install bundle for Unix builds |

## Packs, modes, and compression

### Context packs

- `onboarding`: start here when you need to understand a project fast
- `pr_review`: emphasizes review-oriented context and recent changes
- `risk_review`: highlights likely regression hotspots, broad-impact modules, missing coverage, and maintenance weak spots
- `debug`: pushes suspicious and changed areas upward
- `backend` / `frontend`: bias selection toward that side of the app
- `changes_related`: starts from git changes and expands outward
- `custom`: leaves all fine-tuning to you

### Context modes

- `full`: fastest orientation plus the full selected code payload
- `debug`: favors hotspots, changed files, and likely failure paths
- `feature`: biases selection around the focus query
- `diff`: starts from git changes and nearby context
- `onboarding`: richer explanatory structure for first-time reading
- `refactor`: emphasizes central modules and connected files

### Compression modes

- `full`: keeps fuller file bodies and prioritizes fidelity
- `balanced`: mixes narrative, excerpts, and full payloads for important files
- `focused`: trims aggressively around the current task/focus
- `signatures`: structural overview for quick scanning

## Quickstart

### Option A: Windows executable

1. Download `contexta.exe` or `contexta-setup.exe`
2. Run it
3. Pick a project folder
4. Choose a pack, mode, task, and compression level
5. Create the pack and paste the Markdown into your AI tool

> Windows SmartScreen can still warn on unsigned open-source executables.

### Option B: Linux executable

1. Download `contexta-linux.tar.gz`
2. Extract it
3. Run `./install.sh` for a user-local install, or launch the bundled `contexta` binary directly

> Some Linux environments may require `python3-tk` if running from source instead.

### Option C: Run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pablokaua03/Contexta.git
cd Contexta
python contexta.py
```

From source, install the runtime dependencies first:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Some Linux environments may still require a separate `tkinter` system package such as `python3-tk`.

python contexta.py /path/to/project --pack onboarding
python contexta.py /path/to/project --pack risk_review

| `--task` | Task profile |
| `--compression` | Compression strategy |
| `--pack` | Preset context pack |
| `-c / --copy` | Copy output to clipboard |
| `-o / --output` | Custom output path |
| `--version` | Print version |

## Prompting tips by AI target

### Generic LLM
- Usually works well: clear task, explicit output format
- Usually avoid: vague goals with no definition of done

### ChatGPT
- Usually works well: concise but precise instructions, short examples when helpful
- Usually avoid: mixing architecture analysis and implementation without priority

### Claude
- Usually works well: structured requests, architecture context plus a scoped goal
- Usually avoid: broad prompts with no prioritization

### Gemini
- Usually works well: broader context with explicit priorities, clear formatting instructions
- Usually avoid: assuming long context removes the need for structure

### Copilot / coding agents
- Usually works well: explicit files, constraints, and expected final state
- Usually avoid: open-ended requests with no target behavior

---

## Token guidance

| Rough size | Heuristic |
|---|---|
| `< 8k` | Usually manageable for most chat and coding tools |
| `8k - 32k` | Often comfortable for mainstream model sessions |
| `32k - 128k` | Better suited to larger-context sessions |
| `> 128k` | Consider long-context workflows or a tighter export |

---

## Build from source

```bash
# Windows
.\build.bat

# Linux / macOS
chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
```

Important:
- Build the Windows executable on Windows and the Linux package on Linux.
- Windows builds use Nuitka and require Visual Studio C++ Build Tools.
- Linux builds create both `dist/contexta` and `dist/contexta-linux.tar.gz`.
- On Debian/Ubuntu, install `python3-tk` before building.

Build outputs:
- Windows: `dist/contexta.exe`
- Windows installer: `dist/contexta-setup.exe` when Inno Setup is installed
- Linux / macOS: `dist/contexta`
- Linux install bundle: `dist/contexta-linux.tar.gz`

If you want the Linux package without setting up Linux locally, run the GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/build-linux.yml` and download the `contexta-linux` artifact.

---

## Run tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/
```

Current suite: run `python -m unittest discover tests/` to see the latest total.

---

## Security and behavior

- Read-only: Contexta does not modify the scanned project
- No runtime telemetry or network requirement in the app itself
- Scan limits prevent runaway exports
- Embedded binary/blob payloads are intentionally suppressed in focused excerpts
- Runtime dependencies are local analysis helpers (`pathspec`, `charset-normalizer`, `tiktoken`, `tree-sitter`, and `rapidfuzz`), not cloud services
