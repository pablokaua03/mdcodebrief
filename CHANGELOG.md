## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-11

### Changed
- **Contexta rebrand** — the app now ships as `Contexta`, with refreshed green branding, a new window title, and build output renamed to `contexta`
- **Premium daily-use interface** — redesigned the GUI around packs, context modes, AI targets, task presets, compression controls, and a live pack preview
- **Curated export pipeline** — exports now start with structural analysis instead of jumping straight into raw file dumps

### Added
- **Project Summary** — every pack now opens with detected technologies, likely entry points, important files, architecture notes, and likely purpose
- **Smart context modes** — added `full`, `debug`, `feature`, `diff`, `onboarding`, and `refactor` selection strategies
- **Relationship map** — Contexta now infers local dependencies and likely related test files
- **Task + AI profiles** — exports can be shaped for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, or a generic LLM, plus review/debug/refactor/test-focused tasks
- **Context compression** — added balanced, focused, and signatures-only modes to reduce wasted tokens
- **More renderer coverage** — tests now cover the new summary sections and compression behavior

### Fixed
- **Theme toggle polish** — restored real sun/moon visuals in the header instead of literal fallback text
- **Executable naming** — build scripts now generate `contexta.exe`

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-11

### Changed
- **Compact, resizable interface** — reduced the default window size, added proper resize behavior, and tightened spacing so the app feels lighter on smaller screens
- **App branding refresh** — the GUI now uses the bundled `icon.ico` as the real window/app icon instead of the default feather-style fallback
- **Safer diff flow** — diff mode now behaves more predictably when there are no changed files, instead of surprising the user with a full-project export

### Added
- **36 unit tests** — expanded coverage for hidden-file filtering, diff behavior, renderer output, and related safety cases

### Fixed
- **Hidden file filtering** — dotfiles such as `.env` stay excluded by default when hidden files are not enabled
- **Git diff detection** — changed-file exports now better reflect staged, unstaged, and new-file workflows
- **Clipboard reliability** — clipboard writes now happen on the Tk main thread to avoid intermittent GUI issues

## [1.3.0] — 2025-04-10

### Changed
- **Modular architecture** — split into `scanner.py`, `renderer.py`, `theme.py`, `ui.py`, `cli.py`; `mdcodebrief.py` is now a clean 20-line entry point
- **Improved `.gitignore` parser** — now supports negation (`!`), rooted patterns (`/build`), directory-only patterns (`dist/`), and `**` wildcards
- **Version consistency** — `__version__` unified across all modules

### Added
- **33 unit tests** — covering scanner, renderer, gitignore parser, token estimation, and tree building (`unittest`, zero extra dependencies)
- Screenshot added to README with download button

### Fixed
- Windows SmartScreen false positive — removed `--add-data` from build scripts (`--noupx` retained)

## [1.2.0] — 2025-04-10

### Added
- Dark / Light theme toggle (instant switch, no rebuild)
- Pill-style toggle switches replacing checkboxes
- Two-column layout (AI Instruction + Options side by side)
- Status pill indicator (shows Scanning… / Done ✓ / Error)

### Fixed
- White Entry field on Windows (readonly state color bug)
- Progress bar style name incompatible with Python 3.14

---

## [1.1.0] — 2025-04-10

### Added
- Native `.gitignore` support
- Copy to clipboard — GUI button + `--copy` / `-c` CLI flag
- Token estimation with model hints in log and footer
- Git diff mode — `--diff` and `--staged` flags
- AI instruction injection — GUI text field + `-p / --prompt` CLI flag
- Build scripts (`build.bat`, `build.sh`)
