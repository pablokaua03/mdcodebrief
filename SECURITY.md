## Security notes

- `mdcodebrief` is a **read-only** tool — it never modifies, deletes or uploads any files
- It makes **no network requests** of any kind
- It has **zero external runtime dependencies**
- On some Linux distributions, `tkinter` may come from a system package such as `python3-tk`
- Optional executable builds use **PyInstaller**, which is a packaging dependency rather than a runtime dependency
- All processing happens locally on your machine
